# app-library customized project
Applibrary website to get tweaked apps and games

There is a website called https://itweak.vip/ and I copied the website and uploaded it to my website called https://applibrary.org/
It has one obfuscated .js file which I'd like you to unobfuscate and check if there is any malicious codes being called that
 could redirect a % of my traffic or do something malicious in similiar fashion. 
Then I'd like you to tweak it to my liking code and design wise


1. Custom text for each app below app icon
2. "Injection required" - custom text for every app
3. "Start injection" - custom text for every app
4. Loading screen after pressing "Start injection":
a) First line "Injecting" customizable for each app
b) Loading bar speed and status text customizable for each app
5. The link that person is redirected to when progress bar hits 100% should be called from .php or something like that to prevent thieves stealing the website and changing the links.
<span class="locker-link"></span> is the link location in index.html
6.Homepage on PC should look like this (QR code will be provided) ((I will send you photo in a few minutes))
7. The website should be written in such manner that using HTTracker or copying source files would result in not work site for the thief.
